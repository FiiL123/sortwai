    The document describes multiple waste categories and what bin they should be put in.

    and items that do not.

    For every waste category mentioned, create a `Category` node.
    For each waste item mentioned in the document, create a `Waste` node.
    Every waste item has to be put in some bin as described by the document.
    Create a relation BELONGS_IN between each waste item and waste category it belongs to.
    Create a relation BELONGS_IN between each waste category and a node with a `Bin` label that the waste category should be recycled in.
    For every waste item that does not belongs to a particular category, create a PROHIBITED_IN relation.
    Do not create cyclic relations.
